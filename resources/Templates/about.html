					<h3>
						Open Source Financial Revolution
					</h3>
					<h4>Your Key to Transparent Financial Freedom</h4>
					<p>
						At Budget Control, we believe that financial freedom should be accessible to everyone, without hidden costs or proprietary restrictions. Our open-source approach means complete transparency: you can inspect our code, understand how your data is processed, and trust that there are no backdoors or secret algorithms. We're not just a financial appâ€”we're a movement towards democratizing personal finance management.

					<h3>
						Community-Driven Development
					</h3>
					<h4>Built by Developers, for Everyone</h4>
					<p>
						What sets Budget Control apart is our commitment to open-source principles. Every line of code is publicly available, auditable, and improvable by the community. We believe that financial tools should be owned by their users, not by corporations seeking profit. By choosing open source, we ensure that Budget Control remains forever free, secure, and aligned with user needs rather than shareholder interests.
